simple page with responsive menu (left menu hides when at 680px mark and top menu shows which is drop down)

the media queries giving some weird quirks on smaller sizes with image dimensions and screen sizes etc

remember that the .scss files need to compile correctly to see changes...for any subsequent work  ie.  check and save often
